Below is a comprehensive overview of the MediSchedule project as it stands, along with a `README.md` file that includes the file structure and instructions. This summary captures the key components, functionality, and structure up to this point, so you can easily pick it up in a new chat.

### Full Idea of the MediSchedule Project (Up to This Point)

**Project Name**: MediSchedule  
**Purpose**: A web-based healthcare appointment scheduling system designed to streamline booking and management of medical appointments for patients, doctors, and administrators.

#### Core Features
1. **User Roles**:
   - **Patients**: 
     - Search for doctors by specialty, name, and preferred date via `index.jsp`.
     - Book appointments from available time slots in `userProfile.jsp`.
     - View their booked appointments.
   - **Admins**: 
     - View dashboard (`adminDashboard.jsp`) with appointment stats.
     - Manage (edit/update/cancel) appointments via `appointment.jsp`.
   - **Doctors**: (Future scope; currently placeholder login in `index.jsp`.)

2. **Appointment Booking**:
   - Patients select doctors based on specialty, name, and date, filtered by availability (`doctors_availability.txt`).
   - Time slots are generated dynamically (30-minute increments) and checked against existing appointments.
   - Emergency appointments are prioritized (priority 1 vs. normal priority 2).

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - `index.jsp` search box filters doctors by specialty, name, and date, redirecting to `userProfile.jsp` with results.

4. **Admin Management**:
   - Dashboard displays total appointments, doctors, patients, and emergency queue size.
   - Appointment management includes editing/updating with availability validation.

5. **Data Management**:
   - File-based storage (`data/` directory):
     - `doctors.txt`: `id,email,name,password,specialty`
     - `patients.txt`: `id,email,name,password`
     - `appointments.txt`: `id,patientId,doctorId,dateTime,priority`
     - `doctors_availability.txt`: `doctorId,day,startTime,endTime`

6. **UI/UX**:
   - Modern, responsive design with gradients, shadows, and hover animations.
   - Dark/light theme toggle.
   - Consistent color scheme (`--primary: #2c5282`, `--secondary: #48bb78`, `--accent: #ed8936`).

#### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: JSP with CSS (Font Awesome for icons).
- **Backend**: Java Servlets, JSTL for dynamic content.
- **Dependencies**: Gson (for JSON responses), Maven for build management.
- **Storage**: Plain text files (future scope: database integration).

#### Key Components
1. **JSP Pages**:
   - `index.jsp`: Landing page with search and login/logout.
   - `userProfile.jsp`: Patient dashboard for booking and viewing appointments.
   - `adminDashboard.jsp`: Admin overview with stats and navigation.
   - `appointment.jsp`: Admin interface for managing appointments.

2. **Servlets**:
   - `UserServlet.java`: Handles patient search and booking.
   - `AppointmentServlet.java`: Manages admin appointment edits/updates.
   - `AdminServlet.java`: (Assumed) Powers admin dashboard data.
   - `LogoutServlet.java`: (Assumed) Handles logout.

3. **Services**:
   - `AppointmentService.java`: Core logic for appointment CRUD operations.
   - `DoctorAvailabilityService.java`: Manages doctor availability and time slots.
   - `FileHandler.java`: (Assumed) Utility for file I/O.

#### Workflow
1. **Patient Flow**:
   - Search on `index.jsp` → Redirect to `userProfile.jsp` with filtered doctors → Select doctor, date, and time slot → Book appointment.
2. **Admin Flow**:
   - View `adminDashboard.jsp` → Navigate to `appointment.jsp` → Edit/update/cancel appointments with availability checks.

#### Current Status
- Fully functional patient booking with search and availability checks.
- Admin dashboard and appointment management working, with dynamic time slot generation.
- UI polished with responsive design and animations.
- Missing: Doctor-specific features, registration flow, and database integration.

#### Future Enhancements
- Doctor dashboard (`doctorProfile.jsp`) to view/manage their appointments.
- User registration (`register.jsp` and `RegisterServlet.java`).
- Replace file storage with a database (e.g., MySQL).
- Add appointment cancellation for patients in `userProfile.jsp`.
